# Advent of Code Solutions

Projects:
* **utils**: my custom utilities.
* **y20XX**: my solutions for the specified year.
* **current**: my "work desk". I always use this project when solving puzzles,
and then I copy the solution to the appropriate y20XX project. Contains a template
that I rename and use on each day.
